🗼 The objective of this game is to build as tall a tower as you can! Easy, right?

🏗 You’re presented with choices on the left side of the screen. Some of these choices are more sustainable than others — choose them to minimize your carbon footprint score! Clicking a choice will add it to the top of the tower and increase your carbon footprint.

💥 Keep making choices to make your tower taller but beware: if your carbon footprint gets too big, your tower will fall!

🌱 Be sure to read the summary to see how you can make more sustainable choices.
